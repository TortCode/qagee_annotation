The Attorney General of Canada, the Ontario government, Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service and London Police Service were named as defendants.Story continues below advertisementOn the morning of Aug. 10, 2016, U.S. authorities notified the RCMP they had detected a so-called martyrdom video in which a Canadian man said he was about to conduct an attack.The RCMP identified the man in the video as Driver and a tactical team surrounded his house in Strathroy.At 3:45 p.m., Driver called for a cab to take him to Citi Plaza in London. The claim alleged that despite the police presence, Duffield was not stopped from pulling into Driver’s driveway. Driver then came out of the house and got into the back seat of the cab.“When the SWAT team approached the vehicle, [Duffield] turned to Mr. Driver and said, ‘I think they’re here to talk to you’ and he leaned over to get his cigarettes, it’s a bench seat in the front of the taxicab, as he put his head down below the bench seat, the bomb went off.”Story continues below advertisementThe inside of the cab where Aaron Driver detonated an explosive device on Aug. 10, 2016. Handout / RCMPEgan said Duffield had a preexisting back injury and the bomb blast triggered recurring pain. He also noted that his client was psychologically impacted by the event and is no longer able to work as a taxi driver.“He did try it. Got in a vehicle, turned the key on and started to shake and sweat and got out of the vehicle and vomited,” said Egan. Tweet This“He was so traumatized by the event. He realized that any time any potential passenger was approaching the vehicle with a package he would be hyper-vigilant about that and just couldn’t handle it emotionally.”Details of the settlement will not be made public, but Egan noted that no amount of money can properly compensate someone for physical or psychological injuries, but “is the best we can do in the circumstance.” He also noted that, while he was unwilling to disclose too much of Duffield’s personal health, he has received some counselling and is “coping better now than he was then.”Story continues below advertisement– with files from Stewart Bell and Andrew Russell.\\nAttack\\nQ: Who attacked?\\nA: ISIS\\nQ: When did the attack happen?'"

She offers compelling, if circumstantial, indications that Iraqi operatives helped to plot, prepare and execute murderous attacks in Oklahoma City (and perhaps against other targets in the United States). \\n\\nQ: What is the modus operandi of Saddam Hussein according to Dr. Laurie Mylroie’s thesis? \\nA: According to this thesis, the first attempt aimed at destroying the Twin Towers was not exclusively accomplished by followers of a blind Egyptian sheik with ties to Iran. This conclusion was actually a bonus for Hussein, because it vectored blame at Iran, his most formidable enemy and neighbor. Similarly, Oklahoma City was not, as prosecutors claimed, simply the homegrown handiwork of two violently disaffected U.S. citizens. And Sept. 11 was not the product solely of Usama bin Laden\\'s al Qaeda network.
