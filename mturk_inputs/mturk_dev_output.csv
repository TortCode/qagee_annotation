road_ied_8,"Roadside IED <trigger id='trigger-0'>kills</trigger> Russian major general in Syria The desert south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime’s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgents Russia’s foray into Syria took yet another heavy toll this week, when that nation’s Defense Ministry <trigger id='trigger-13'>confirmed</trigger> that a major general was <trigger id='trigger-1'>killed</trigger> in Syria by an improvised explosive device, Al-Monitor online <trigger id='trigger-2'>reported</trigger>. Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh <trigger id='trigger-3'>died</trigger> after a roadside IED detonated under a convoy of Russian soldiers and Syrian pro-regime militiamen near the city of Deir ez-Zor. Three other Russian military personnel were <trigger id='trigger-4'>wounded</trigger>, Russia’s state-run Tass news agency <trigger id='trigger-14'>reported</trigger>. A local commander of Syria’s National Defense Forces, a pro-Assad militia, was also reportedly <trigger id='trigger-5'>killed</trigger>. “They’ve changed their tactics there,” <trigger id='trigger-15'>said</trigger> one source, who declined to be named for security reasons. “They do nighttime infiltrations, lay mines and booby traps.” Video purporting to show the explosion circulated on social media this week. It was the first reported death of a Russian general in Syria since 2017, when a lieutenant general was <trigger id='trigger-6'>killed</trigger> in the same province, reportedly by mortar fire from the Islamic State, Al-Monitor <trigger id='trigger-7'>reported</trigger>. Deir ez-Zor and nearly all of Syrian territory west of the Euphrates River lie in Syrian government hands, with the major exception of Idlib province, the last rebel enclave in the country’s nearly decadelong civil war. US-backed and Kurdish-led militias captured IS’last remaining territory in March 2019, but the desert countryside south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime’s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgents who continue to ambush pro-Syrian regime forces, Al-Monitor <trigger id='trigger-10'>reported</trigger>. Syria’s eastern Badia, or desert, remains the country’s last significant hot spot of IS activity. In April, more than two dozen Syrian pro-regime fighters were <trigger id='trigger-8'>killed</trigger> in IS <trigger id='trigger-11'>attacks</trigger> in Badia al-Sukhnah and Badia al-Sham, prompting Russian airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Killings of local tribal figures recently rocked the east side of the Euphrates in Deir ez-Zor, which is controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Al-Monitor <trigger id='trigger-9'>reported</trigger>. It is not clear who carried out the slayings, though locals have alternatively blamed IS and the Assad regime. A US official told Al-Monitor last month that there could be anywhere from 2, 000 to 10, 000 IS insurgents in sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria. Coalition spokesman US Army Col. Myles Caggins III told Al-Monitor that the US recently provided Iraqi authorities with “several million dollars’worth” of border security infrastructure to interdict illicit <trigger id='trigger-12'>smuggling</trigger> in the border area. The Pentagon says US special forces at the isolated al-Tanf base in the Badia are there to keep pressure on IS in the border area, but rebels have told Al-Monitor that the proximity of Russian and Syrian forces on the roads outside the US-controlled zone make operations outside the area difficult.

Aug. 7, 2017 Pro-government supporters holding Venezuela’s flag <trigger id='trigger-7'>march</trigger> in Caracas. Ueslei Marcelino / Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Yet on Sunday, critics say, an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized, reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over. In defiance of international warnings, the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution, supplant the opposition-controlled legislature and potentially keep Maduro in power indefinitely. The opposition on Thursday called for three days of massive, nationwide <trigger id='trigger-9'>protests</trigger> as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the <trigger id='trigger-8'>slaying</trigger> of seven more demonstrators in two days. Responding to the spiraling tensions, the U. S. State Department <trigger id='trigger-10'>ordered</trigger> the departure of family members of American staff at its embassy in Caracas. It also authorized voluntary departures for American staff, and issued a broad travel warning for U. S. citizens. Maduro — the anointed successor of firebrand leader Hugo Chávez, who <trigger id='trigger-11'>died</trigger> in 2013 — strongly defends the new assembly, <trigger id='trigger-33'>saying</trigger> it will fortify what he hails as “the communal state.” While it’s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution, it would likely give more power to “communal councils” in poor neighborhoods. Leaders of those councils, critics say, are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds. On the surface, the assembly vote, along with the government’s pseudo-Soviet speak, hark back to old-school Marxist regimes. But many here see something perhaps more <trigger id='trigger-12'>sinister</trigger> emerging — a 21st-century thugocracy that rules by <trigger id='trigger-35'>coercion</trigger>, extortion and violence. About 100 people have <trigger id='trigger-13'>died</trigger> in three months of anti-government street protests. <trigger id='trigger-14'>Arrests</trigger> of political activists have accelerated. Bands of pro-government toughs — known as colectivos — roam poor neighborhoods, waving guns, intimidating protesters and journalists, <trigger id='trigger-15'>beating</trigger> opposition politicians, and warning locals to toe the government line. [How a new kind of protest movement has arisen in Venezuela] More than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum July 16. Opposition parties are boycotting the election. In a country where the government is the largest employer, state workers say they are being ordered to vote Sunday, at the risk of losing their jobs. HIV patients say officials have <trigger id='trigger-16'>threatened</trigger> to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election. Families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up — a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages. Such threats are not idle, either. Yanelis Banco, 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant, said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week. He ordered them, she said, to sign a form pledging to vote Sunday. She and five other senior staffers refused. All of them <trigger id='trigger-17'>lost</trigger> their jobs, she said. “I’m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months, so I didn’t think they’d fire me,” she said. “Why do I have to sign if I don’t agree? I thought the law protected me!” She added: “All the other employees are terrified. Now they’re sure that if they don’t vote, they’ll be fired. None of them can afford that.” [Stuck in a death spiral, Venezuela is borrowing money at any cost] Maduro has acknowledged that the government is <trigger id='trigger-18'>pressuring</trigger> public employees to vote. At a rally with public energy workers this month, he said: “Take the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee. For each business, call all the workers and organize how they’ll vote on July 30th. At the end of the day, check the list. If there are 15, 000 workers, there have to be 15, 000 votes, with no excuses.” Venezuela’s political <trigger id='trigger-19'>protests</trigger> have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy, growing authoritarian rule and the government’s resistance to early elections. The country’s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro’s six-year term. The council also pushed back elections for governors, scheduled for 2016, to December of this year. Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those, as well as the presidential election in 2018. The U. S. Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami’s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro-government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition-led legislature. On Wednesday, the Trump administration targeted 13 more Venezuelan officials, alleging <trigger id='trigger-0'>violations</trigger> of human rights and corruption. [Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote] Once the richest country per capita in South America due to its vast oil reserves, Venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums. The result was Chávez, who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs, even as he concentrated power. He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans, although many others — especially in the middle and upper classes — loathe him. Maduro’s approval rating, on the other hand, is hovering around 20 percent, with opponents calling this weekend’s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace. He has promised Venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability. “July 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement,” Maduro told a campaign rally this week. Yet many Venezuelans fear just the opposite — a deepening of official repression. It is already starting, they say. Take, for instance, 51-year-old Lisbeth Añez, or “Mama Lis.” For years, she was known for aiding anti-government protesters, bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas, or cornmeal cakes. In May, she was <trigger id='trigger-20'>arrested</trigger> and <trigger id='trigger-21'>charged</trigger> with treason. Her case is in the hands of a military tribunal. In recent months, scores of civilians who have taken part in <trigger id='trigger-22'>demonstrations</trigger> or other perceived anti-government acts have been <trigger id='trigger-23'>sent</trigger> into the military court system, where they can face lengthy prison <trigger id='trigger-24'>sentences</trigger>. “I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, even if we had enough food,” said her son, Luis González Añez, 23, who said he was refused entry to her <trigger id='trigger-25'>trial</trigger>. “I have nightmares, thinking about her in jail. . . I didn’t think things could get worse, but they have.” Gabriela Ramírez, Venezuela’s former public ombudsman and a longtime Chávez supporter, <trigger id='trigger-29'>said</trigger> she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship. “We will have a narco-authoritarian regime,” she said. Ramírez, who carries around a pocket version of Chávez’s 1999 constitution in her purse, is among the ranks of former “Chavistas” — or Chávez backers — who have turned against Maduro. She has paid for it with harassment, she said, including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media. “There will no longer be any check on their power,” she said. “They will control everything.” Following an opposition-called 48-hour strike, the government on Thursday issued a <trigger id='trigger-30'>ban</trigger> on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday. The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization, <trigger id='trigger-31'>asking</trigger> citizens to <trigger id='trigger-26'>take</trigger> to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains. In an interview, Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly, played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote. Former Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero is in Caracas, and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition. Guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote. “It is wishful thinking,” he said. “I am sure they are going forward with this scam, and that we are going to respond with pressure.” But even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that Maduro will back down. Scenarios for what happens next range widely. Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen, prompting, perhaps, a military coup or fueling an anti-government guerrilla movement. Others say the government, likely with the aid of Russia and China, will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah. Still others see a worst-case scenario of social implosion and anarchy. “Somalia,” <trigger id='trigger-32'>said</trigger> Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda. “We could become a failed state.” Mariana Zuñiga contributed to this report.

scenario_en_kairos_75,"Dagestan profile Published duration 17 January 2018 The Russian Republic of Dagestan, which translates as""land of the mountains"", is situated in Russia's turbulent North Caucasus with Chechnya and Georgia to the west, Azerbaijan to the south and the Caspian Sea to the east. So high are its peaks in some places that certain areas are accessible only by helicopter. The republic is also famed for its ethnic and linguistic diversity, being home to more than 30 languages. Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries. image copyright AFP image caption Villages cling to steep hillsides in Dagestan's spectacular mountainous interior The Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population. A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins, Kumyks and Lezgins. About 10 per cent are ethnic Russians. There are also Laks, Tabasarans and Nogai, to name but a few of the other significant groups. The republic's constitution <trigger id='trigger-0'>declares</trigger> the protection of the interests of all of Dagestan's peoples to be a fundamental principle. It is a delicate balance to maintain, in what is Russia's most ethnically diverse province. The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea. However, it is prey to organized <trigger id='trigger-1'>crime</trigger> and regional instability. The crime barons may prosper but the people are amongst the poorest in Russia. History Dagestan was the birth place of Imam Shamil, the legendary fighter who in the 19th century spearheaded fierce <trigger id='trigger-2'>resistance</trigger> by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire. His name is still revered by many in both republics. image copyright AFP image caption Federal troops were deployed to <trigger id='trigger-3'>repel</trigger> incursions by Chechen militants in the 1990s When the Bolsheviks sought to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s, Dagestan became an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation. During the Stalinist period, its peoples <trigger id='trigger-19'>escaped</trigger> the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic's authorities stayed loyal to Russia, but the region became infamous for its lawlessness and corruption. Organised <trigger id='trigger-4'>crime</trigger> is reported to flourish and kidnappings and violence are commonplace. <trigger id='trigger-5'>Firearms</trigger> are ubiquitous and <trigger id='trigger-6'>assassinations</trigger> are a regular event. Moscow <trigger id='trigger-7'>blames</trigger> much of this on Chechen-based separatism, but others <trigger id='trigger-8'>say</trigger> lust for profit, combined with a gun culture, is the root cause. Budennovsk and beyond In the 1990s, separatist warlords from neighbouring Chechen openly led armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions. In 1995 and 1996, they <trigger id='trigger-9'>seized</trigger> hundreds of hostages in hospitals in the Dagestani towns of Budennovsk and Kizlyar. Scores <trigger id='trigger-10'>died</trigger> in the <trigger id='trigger-11'>attacks</trigger>. image copyright AFP image caption Dagestan sees frequent <trigger id='trigger-12'>attacks</trigger> on security forces and <trigger id='trigger-13'>assassinations</trigger> Dagestan's Muslims, who tend to follow sufism combined with local tradition, generally steered clear of Chechen-style separatism, but after the late 1990s, radical and militant elements said to be linked with the more fundamentalist wahhabist tendency began to gain in influence. In August 1999, an Islamic body <trigger id='trigger-14'>declared</trigger> an independent state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya, and <trigger id='trigger-15'>called</trigger> on Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war. Chechen fighters <trigger id='trigger-16'>crossed</trigger> into Dagestan in support, but within a few weeks, Russian forces had <trigger id='trigger-17'>suppressed</trigger> the insurrection. The republic has seen numerous <trigger id='trigger-18'>bombings</trigger> targeted at the Russian military stationed in the republic.

64_VOA_EN_NW_2017.06.05.3887168,"British Security Services Questioned About Surveillance Priorities LONDON — For the second time in a month Britain’s security services are facing awkward questions about their surveillance policies, after it emerged the ringleader of Saturday’s terror <trigger id='trigger-0'>attack</trigger> in the heart of London was known to them and had been interrogated in the past. The British-Pakistani, who police are not naming for operational reasons, was also a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the east London district of Barking, where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park, sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident. The 27-year-old, father of at least two young children, appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, a convicted IS recruiter. Last month, community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi, the British-Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert <trigger id='trigger-1'>bombing</trigger> in the city, accused the security services of missing several opportunities to <trigger id='trigger-2'>identify</trigger> him as a high-risk militant. FILE-A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017. At least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22-year-old suicide bomber. One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK. Insufficient response Neither Britain’s domestic intelligence service MI5 nor the Manchester police responded to the claims, but lawmakers have demanded to know why Abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation. FILE-Salman Abedi, the bomber behind the Manchester suicide <trigger id='trigger-3'>bombing</trigger>, is seen in this image taken from CCTV on the night he committed the <trigger id='trigger-4'>attack</trigger> in this handout photo released, May 27, 2017, from the Greater Manchester Police. Similar questions are being prompted again in the wake of the van-and-knife <trigger id='trigger-5'>attack</trigger> in the London Bridge district of Britain’s capital. Erica Gasparri, a mother of three who lived in Barking told local media she had reported Abedi two years ago, after he approached kids in a local park. She says she confronted him after her two children came home and said, “Mummy I want to become a Muslim.” The parents of the ringleader of Saturday’s <trigger id='trigger-6'>attack</trigger> are reported to have been asylum seekers from Pakistan. According to local media, the man, nicknamed Abz, worked at various times for a fast-food outlet, a clothing store and subsequently for the London Underground system. FILE-Police attend to an incident on London Bridge in London, Britain, June 3, 2017. A onetime friend of the ringleader also told the BBC that he warned police, alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist <trigger id='trigger-7'>attacks</trigger> in Britain and of his alarm at the man's increasingly extremist beliefs. The friend said the alleged attacker was a keen follower of American radical preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril and would watch YouTube videos of the cleric. “He used to listen to a lot of Musa Jibril,” he told the BBC. “I phoned the anti-terror hotline. I spoke to the gentleman. I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized. . . I did my bit, I know a lot of other people did their bit, but the authorities did not do their bit,” he added. Security strategy review A senior Conservative official told VOA that there is deep frustration in Downing Street about Saturday’s attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities. Prime Minister Theresa May promised to review Britain’s counter-terrorism strategy, holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the security services and longer jail sentences for extremists. She said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.

scenario_en_8,"The Minister of Health, Nancy Perez, spoke today on the status of two <trigger id='trigger-0'>diseases</trigger> currently affecting Venezuelans: chikungunya and dengue fever. Perez confirmed that so far in 2014, there have been 398 cases of <trigger id='trigger-1'>chikungunya</trigger> and 45, 745 cases of dengue <trigger id='trigger-2'>fever</trigger> in the country. Both diseases are mosquito-borne. The mortality rate for dengue fever ranges between 1-5%. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the mortality for chikungunya during an outbreak in Africa in 2005-2006 was nearly 0%. Perez conceded that the country is experiencing a shortage of acetaminophen, a medicine used as a pain killer and fever reducer used to combat the symptoms of the diseases. However, Perez assured, the government is doing all it can to resolve the shortage. Doctors Want Emergency Declared The head of the infectious diseases department at the Hospital Universitario de Caracas, Maria Eugenia Landaeta, called on the government today to declare the chikungunya <trigger id='trigger-3'>outbreak</trigger> an emergency. Landaeta said: It’s the first thing you should do because that allows for planification and for the allocation of resources to attack the virus. Landaeta also speculated that the nine unexplained deaths over the last week in Aragua might have been the result of complications from the disease. She said: What we’re thinking, based on the symptoms, is that it could be an instance of complicated cases of chikungunya. She also dismissed the rumours that the disease might be ebola, saying that as far as she was aware none of the victims had any contact whatsoever with anyone from Africa. Landaeta also called on Venezuelans to think critically, and to not fall into a “collective panic” regarding these diseases. Alleged Ongoing Confrontation Leaves Students Injured An alleged ongoing confrontation in or around the Universidad de Los Andes campus in Tachira state between students and security forces has left at least one student injured.

scenario_en_85,"At around midnight last night, the freshly U. S.-sanctioned head of the government’s National Elections Council popped up on our screens to announce the results of yesterday’s doomstituyente election. By results I don’t mean “the winners” — only the governing party was running — but turnout: how many people actually showed up to grace yesterday’s with their presence. Her number — 8, 089, 320 — instantly underlined what we’ve known for some time: damnit, we’re going to need a new Elections Council These people somehow figured out a way to <trigger id='trigger-1'>commit</trigger> fraud in an election where they were running unopposed. To believe yesterday’s turnout figure you’d have to believe that somehow, amid the most terrifying economic and social crisis in Venezuelan history, with 3 out of 4 people actually losing bodyweight because they’re so hungry, the government got more popular, not less. Miraculously an extra 2. 4 million people decided they want to go for the government, compared to their tally of 5, 622, 844 at parliamentary elections 19 months ago. Somehow, we’re told, the Constituent Assembly is virtually as popular as Hugo Chávez was, with cancer, at the height of the 2012 oil boom. It’s a figure that strains all credulity, and whose only function is to establish beyond a shadow of doubt that CNE, on top of enabling all kinds of unfair play in the run-up to an election, can no longer even be trusted to do the one thing it had just about managed to do credibly up to now: count the actual votes. These people somehow figured out a way to <trigger id='trigger-0'>commit</trigger> fraud in an election where they were running unopposed. It’s amazing — like cheating at solitaire. Since 2012, CNE has suffered the same transformation as the Supreme Tribunal has: going from a reliably friendly pro-government organ that nonetheless recognized the need to keep a minimum plausibility, to “pass” as an actual institution, to a fully subservient branch office of Miraflores.

32_VOA_EN_NW_2014.06.04.1929720,"Kyrgyzstan National Pleads Not Guilty to Hampering Boston Bomb Probe BOSTON — A citizen of Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to <trigger id='trigger-0'>charges</trigger> of lying to federal investigators about his ties to the two ethnic Chechen men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon <trigger id='trigger-1'>bombing</trigger>. Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, faces one criminal count of <trigger id='trigger-2'>destroying</trigger> records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation. He is not charged with taking part in the April 15, 2013, <trigger id='trigger-3'>attack</trigger>, which <trigger id='trigger-4'>killed</trigger> three people and <trigger id='trigger-5'>injured</trigger> more than 260. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered Matanov held until <trigger id='trigger-6'>trial</trigger>, after his attorney noted that it was unclear how the man would support himself after losing his job as a taxi driver following his <trigger id='trigger-10'>arrest</trigger>. She left open the option for his lawyer to seek his pretrial <trigger id='trigger-11'>release</trigger> if he were to find living arrangements. Matanov's involvement An FBI agent who had worked on his case acknowledged under cross-examination by defense attorney Edward Hayden that Matanov, who lived in Quincy, Massachusetts, had shown up at a local police station the morning of April 19, 2013, while a manhunt was under way for suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to identify the man, but that the FBI had not <trigger id='trigger-7'>interviewed</trigger> him until the next day. Hayden noted that charging papers pointed out that Matanov had dinner with the suspected bombers, Dzhokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the night of the <trigger id='trigger-8'>attack</trigger> and discussed the incident. Hayden asked FBI Special Agent Timothy McElroy undercross-examination if there was any evidence that Matanov at the time had suspected the Tsarnaevs of being involved in the attack.""There's nothing in here, no,""said McElroy, consulting court papers. Pending charges Prosecutors said Matanov deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer and tried to dispose of cell phones he described as illegal after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers on April 18, 2013. Matanov was brought into court on Wednesday handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. His attorney said he entered the United States in 2010 on a student visa and was later granted political asylum due to ethnic clashes in his native Kyrgyzstan. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is being held in a federal prison west of Boston awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted. Tamerlan, 26, <trigger id='trigger-12'>died</trigger> after a gunfight with police three days after the <trigger id='trigger-9'>bombing</trigger>.

He <trigger id='trigger-39'>said</trigger>:""I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly <trigger id='trigger-38'>attacks</trigger> on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.""This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling <trigger id='trigger-40'>crimes</trigger>.""He added that the measures would become apparent""very soon"". On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he <trigger id='trigger-41'>said</trigger>:""The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.""<trigger id='trigger-4'>Shootings</trigger> in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was <trigger id='trigger-5'>killed</trigger> and five more were <trigger id='trigger-6'>wounded</trigger>, in a <trigger id='trigger-13'>battle</trigger> between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have <trigger id='trigger-42'>hit</trigger> three gunmen. Later, a man was shot <trigger id='trigger-18'>dead</trigger> when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city. Just after 11. 30pm a wave of <trigger id='trigger-19'>shooting</trigger> broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial <trigger id='trigger-20'>shooting</trigger> incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense <trigger id='trigger-21'>gunfire</trigger>. There were no military casualties. In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated <trigger id='trigger-12'>bombing</trigger> at least 11 people <trigger id='trigger-11'>died</trigger>. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were <trigger id='trigger-43'>detained</trigger> in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after <trigger id='trigger-44'>treatment</trigger>. The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the <trigger id='trigger-22'>bombings</trigger>, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes'<trigger id='trigger-24'>warning</trigger> was given before each <trigger id='trigger-23'>explosion</trigger>, but the <trigger id='trigger-25'>warnings</trigger> which were received were so vague as to be almost useless. A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned <trigger id='trigger-26'>warnings</trigger> were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each <trigger id='trigger-27'>explosion</trigger>. In the case of the two worst <trigger id='trigger-14'>explosions</trigger> at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, <trigger id='trigger-45'>warnings</trigger> were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2. 10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion. Huge explosive decides were <trigger id='trigger-28'>detonated</trigger> at places certain to be thronged with people-bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1, 000lb of explosives had been <trigger id='trigger-29'>used</trigger>. At 2. 45pm, when the <trigger id='trigger-30'>bombing</trigger> began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb <trigger id='trigger-31'>exploded</trigger> there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before. Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the <trigger id='trigger-32'>attacks</trigger>, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements. By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had <trigger id='trigger-17'>gone</trigger> off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend. Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately <trigger id='trigger-15'>flew</trigger> back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended. From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent <trigger id='trigger-46'>demands</trigger> last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, <trigger id='trigger-47'>called</trigger> for its""immediate massive resumption"". While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced. The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas-possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations-is becoming very real indeed. If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands. Last night the UDA leaders were <trigger id='trigger-48'>meeting</trigger> in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the <trigger id='trigger-16'>bombing</trigger>, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population. The bombs began to <trigger id='trigger-7'>explode</trigger> before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they <trigger id='trigger-37'>exploded</trigger> roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the <trigger id='trigger-36'>attacks</trigger> continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control. The worst <trigger id='trigger-10'>explosion</trigger> was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were <trigger id='trigger-8'>killed</trigger>. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been <trigger id='trigger-49'>planted</trigger> in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it <trigger id='trigger-50'>exploded</trigger>, <trigger id='trigger-9'>killing</trigger> two soliders instantly and <trigger id='trigger-51'>tearing</trigger> through the waiting-room","[{""event_id"": ""wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_4-E1"", ""text"": ""slaughter"", ""offset"": 47, ""template"": ""[Victim] died at [Place] place

scenario_en_kairos_61,"French police are <trigger id='trigger-16'>hunting</trigger> a suspect believed to have deposited a paper bag containing a device that <trigger id='trigger-0'>exploded</trigger> on Friday, <trigger id='trigger-1'>wounding</trigger> 13 people on a busy pedestrian street in the city of Lyon. France’s counter-terrorism prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said an <trigger id='trigger-2'>investigation</trigger> has been opened for an “attempted <trigger id='trigger-17'>murder</trigger> in relation with a terrorist undertaking” and “criminal terrorist association” . He said no group had yet claimed responsibility for the <trigger id='trigger-3'>explosion</trigger>. Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor <trigger id='trigger-4'>injuries</trigger> but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning. On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the <trigger id='trigger-5'>explosion</trigger> an “attack” . Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect <trigger id='trigger-7'>heading</trigger> toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery. French police <trigger id='trigger-18'>issued</trigger> this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the <trigger id='trigger-6'>explosion</trigger>. Photograph: Police National / Handout / EPA The suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the <trigger id='trigger-19'>explosion</trigger> shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said. Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device. Police <trigger id='trigger-20'>issued</trigger> an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face. Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France’s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols. The Women’s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June. Lyon will host the semi-finals and then the 7 July final. After the <trigger id='trigger-8'>explosion</trigger>, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, <trigger id='trigger-9'>sent</trigger> instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for “public sites and sporting, cultural and religious events” . On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the <trigger id='trigger-21'>explosion</trigger> area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping–the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground. “It was scary,” said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery. Large wood planks covered her shop window, which was <trigger id='trigger-10'>damaged</trigger> by the <trigger id='trigger-13'>blast</trigger>. Police found in her shop screws, metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device, yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning. France is jittery over a spate of <trigger id='trigger-22'>attacks</trigger> in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals. Five people were <trigger id='trigger-12'>killed</trigger> on 11 December in an <trigger id='trigger-11'>attack</trigger> on the Christmas market in Strasbourg, eastern France. The alleged killer, Chérif Chekatt–<trigger id='trigger-14'>shot</trigger> <trigger id='trigger-15'>dead</trigger> by police–had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.

wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_8,"Unmanned aircraft primed specifically to chase and catch weaponised consumer drones will be taken for a spin in the coming months. Anti-drone unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are to be taken for counter-terrorist test flights on a UK military base, E & T has learned. It is understood they will be flown in exercises designed to simulate a real-life pursuit of a terrorist drone. Police and the military are believed to be concerned about the prospect of terrorists modifying small, off-the-shelf drones to launch <trigger id='trigger-0'>attacks</trigger> on British soil. Capturing drones using swarms of net-casting UAVs working in tandem is one of several options being considered by defence chiefs. Developing radio frequency denial systems to create a forcefield-type wall around government sensitive areas could also form part of the longer-term strategy. British engineering firm OpenWorks already manufactures the SkyWall 100, an anti-drone bazooka which launches a net at flying objects and parachutes them to the ground. However, James Rogers, an expert in drone warfare who is associate lecturer at the University of York, predicted “non-kinetic options” would ultimately prove more effective than “blunt force” tactics. “There are loads of different ways to <trigger id='trigger-1'>bring</trigger> down a drone,” he said. “It’s now about finding what is the most effective way to do it. If you <trigger id='trigger-2'>shoot</trigger> it down, well, what if it’s rigged as an improvised explosive device?” On being told about the upcoming test flight event, he said: “There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to <trigger id='trigger-3'>counter</trigger> these small drones, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.” The ISIL terror group has already used basic, easy-to-buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul, where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self-styled caliphate. US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to <trigger id='trigger-4'>carry</trigger> hazardous chemicals, radioactive material or grenades in Western cities. Rogers told E & T: “We talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare. This is kind of the other side of it. These are precision missiles. You can hone in on your exact target. Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is.” Forcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre-set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum, Rogers said, although he added: “You can always override that, so it’s a hard one.” In the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country’s critical infrastructure. It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists. One well-placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far. Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were “just morons” , he added. A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of <trigger id='trigger-5'>colliding</trigger> with a drone. The person controlling the drone was never tracked down. All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games, according to Dave Sloggett, who runs exercises for the police, military and others. “For the last nine months, every single exercise I’ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere,” said Sloggett, who has also authored a book on drone warfare. Criminals have been known to use drones to <trigger id='trigger-6'>carry</trigger> drugs and mobile phones into prisons, over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe. Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons. The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so-called “biomimetic technology” , producing drones based on natural forms, apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments. At the same time, the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries.

wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_3,"There have been many terrible events in the history of Northern Ireland's <trigger id='trigger-0'>conflict</trigger>, but few have seared the collective consciousness of its people as <trigger id='trigger-12'>those</trigger> on Friday, 21 July 1972, a day that became known as Bloody Friday. By the end of the day, the IRA's Belfast brigade had <trigger id='trigger-1'>detonated</trigger> at least 20 bombs across the city. In just 75 minutes of violence, nine people were <trigger id='trigger-2'>dead</trigger> and some 130 more were <trigger id='trigger-3'>mutilated</trigger>, <trigger id='trigger-4'>injured</trigger> and mentally scarred by what they had witnessed. You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the street Police officer at the scene From the outset, the IRA's <trigger id='trigger-5'>bombing</trigger> of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit. Such was the scale of the <trigger id='trigger-13'>attack</trigger>, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being <trigger id='trigger-14'>detonated</trigger>. As one report at the time described the scene,""it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe"". Car bombs While the scale of the <trigger id='trigger-10'>attack</trigger> was huge, it was two car bombs that between them <trigger id='trigger-11'>claimed</trigger> the nine lives-one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast. At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were <trigger id='trigger-9'>killed</trigger>. When the emergency services <trigger id='trigger-15'>reached</trigger> the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally <trigger id='trigger-16'>blown</trigger> to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a <trigger id='trigger-17'>death</trigger> toll of 11. At the Cavehill Road <trigger id='trigger-18'>bomb</trigger>, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy. Of the 130 <trigger id='trigger-7'>injured</trigger>, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene <trigger id='trigger-19'>recalled</trigger> the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.""You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,""he <trigger id='trigger-20'>told</trigger> the series. Collapsed ceasefire In terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday <trigger id='trigger-21'>attacks</trigger> proved to be a disaster. Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment <trigger id='trigger-8'>killed</trigger> 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities. It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time. Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofain By June, the organisation felt confident enough to <trigger id='trigger-22'>call</trigger> a ceasefire and <trigger id='trigger-23'>hold</trigger> secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed. Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible. But after causing the <trigger id='trigger-24'>deaths</trigger>, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings. Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge. Within 10 days of the <trigger id='trigger-25'>attacks</trigger>, the army <trigger id='trigger-26'>moved</trigger> in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long <trigger id='trigger-27'>war</trigger> of attrition by both sides. Denials In later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, <trigger id='trigger-28'>said</trigger> that the aim of the Bloody Friday <trigger id='trigger-29'>attacks</trigger> had been to cause financial damage-but he still refused to accept responsibility.""It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,""he <trigger id='trigger-30'>said</trigger>.""Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.""Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972. It remains the bloodiest year of the <trigger id='trigger-31'>conflict</trigger> in Northern Ireland. By the end of 1972, 496 had been <trigger id='trigger-6'>killed</trigger>, 258 of them civilians.

Angel Sarmiento, president of Aragua Medical School, announced eight people died of the yet unidentified <trigger id='trigger-2'>disease</trigger>. He said it was not Ebola, meningitis, dengue or chikungunya. He added that the victims were four children and four adults. The symptoms exhibited by the dead were spots on the body that turned to boils, high fever, massive hemorrhaging stemming from smaller hemorrhagic incidents, and multi-organ failure. The disease took around 72 hours to run its course.""We don't know what we are confronting,""Sarmiento said.""We don't know if it's a virus or bacteria. How can we heal what we don't know?""However, there may not be any disease to battle. The governor of Aragua, who is also the state's leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, denies Sarmiento's claims, according to the Latin American Herald Tribune. Gov.

wiki_ied_bombings_9,"The Cafetería Rolando bombing was an <trigger id='trigger-0'>attack</trigger> on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which <trigger id='trigger-1'>killed</trigger> 13 people and <trigger id='trigger-2'>wounded</trigger> 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been <trigger id='trigger-23'>carried</trigger> out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA. == Background == The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services. == The attack == The bomb was <trigger id='trigger-24'>placed</trigger> at the entrance to the building and <trigger id='trigger-3'>exploded</trigger> on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the <trigger id='trigger-4'>explosion</trigger>, two of whom were among the <trigger id='trigger-5'>dead</trigger>. The explosion caused significant <trigger id='trigger-6'>damage</trigger> to nearby buildings, <trigger id='trigger-7'>shattering</trigger> the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally <trigger id='trigger-8'>destroyed</trigger>. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to <trigger id='trigger-9'>collapse</trigger> and guests staying in a pension above were <trigger id='trigger-10'>injured</trigger> due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene. Two of the 12 initially <trigger id='trigger-11'>killed</trigger> and 11 of the <trigger id='trigger-12'>injured</trigger> were members of the police force. However the <trigger id='trigger-13'>wounded</trigger> included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim <trigger id='trigger-14'>died</trigger> in 1977 of <trigger id='trigger-18'>injuries</trigger> suffered during the attack. == Responses and arrests == The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, <trigger id='trigger-25'>issued</trigger> a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for <trigger id='trigger-15'>attacks</trigger> carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Piñar, the opportunity to <trigger id='trigger-19'>attack</trigger> the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro. In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the <trigger id='trigger-20'>attack</trigger> on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident. Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were <trigger id='trigger-16'>arrested</trigger>, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falcón, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Peña, construction worker Antonio Durán, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife María del Carmen Nadal, the actress María Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were <trigger id='trigger-17'>charged</trigger> with complicity in the <trigger id='trigger-21'>assassination</trigger> of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were <trigger id='trigger-22'>released</trigger> in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falcón published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable. The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery. == References ==","[{""event_id"": ""wiki_ied_bombings_9-E1"", ""text"": ""attack"", ""offset"": 6, ""template"": ""[Attacker] detonated or exploded [ExplosiveDevice] explosive device using [Instrument] to attack [Target] target at [Place] place"", ""role_text_map"": [{""role"": ""Attacker"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Target"", ""text"": ""Rolando cafe""}, {""role"": ""Instrument"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""ExplosiveDevice"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Place"", ""text"": ""Cafeter\u00eda Rolando""}], ""bootstrap"": ""Question: What was the Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing?\nAnswer: an attack\n\nQuestion: When did the attack happen?\nAnswer: 13 September 1974\n\nQuestion: Where did the attack happen?\nAnswer: Rolando cafe/Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain\n\nQuestion: How many people were killed in the attack?\nAnswer: 13 people\n\nQuestion: How many people were wounded in the attack?\nAnswer: 71 people\n\nQuestion: Who is believed to have carried out the attack?\nAnswer: ETA/Basque separatist group\n\nQuestion: Where was the Rolando Cafe located?\nAnswer: 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security""}, {""event_id"": ""wiki_ied_bombings_9-E2"", ""text"": ""killed"", ""offset"": 24, ""template"": ""[Victim] died at [Place] place from [MedicalIssue] medical issue, killed by [Killer] killer"", ""role_text_map"": [{""role"": ""Victim"", ""text"": ""people""}, {""role"": ""Place"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Killer"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""MedicalIssue"", ""text"": null}], ""bootstrap"": ""Question: What happened at the Cafeter\u00eda Rolando?\nAnswer: a bombing\n\nQuestion: When did the bombing occur?\nAnswer: September 13, 1974\n\nQuestion: Who was killed in the bombing?\nAnswer: 13 people\n\nQuestion: How many people were wounded in the bombing?\nAnswer: 71\n\nQuestion: Who is believed to have carried out the attack?\nAnswer: ETA/Basque separatist group""}, {""event_id"": ""wiki_ied_bombings_9-E3"", ""text"": ""wounded"", ""offset"": 28, ""template"": ""[Victim] was injured by [Injurer] using [Instrument] in [BodyPart] body part with [MedicalCondition] medical issue at [Place] place"", ""role_text_map"": [{""role"": ""Victim"", ""text"": ""71""}, {""role"": ""Injurer"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Instrument"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""BodyPart"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""MedicalCondition"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Place"", ""text"": null}], ""bootstrap"": ""Question: What happened at the Cafeter\u00eda Rolando?\nAnswer: an attack\n\nQuestion: When did the attack happen?\nAnswer: September 13, 1974\n\nQuestion: How many people were killed?\nAnswer: 13\n\nQuestion: How many people were wounded?\nAnswer: 71\n\nQuestion: Who is believed to have carried out the attack?\nAnswer: ETA/Basque separatist group\n\nQuestion: Where was the Cafeter\u00eda Rolando located?\nAnswer: 4 Calle del Correo, Madrid""}, {""event_id"": ""wiki_ied_bombings_9-E4"", ""text"": ""exploded"", ""offset"": 117, ""template"": ""[Attacker] detonated or exploded [ExplosiveDevice] explosive device using [Instrument] to attack [Target] target at [Place] place"", ""role_text_map"": [{""role"": ""Attacker"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Target"", ""text"": ""building""}, {""role"": ""Instrument"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""ExplosiveDevice"", ""text"": ""bomb""}, {""role"": ""Place"", ""text"": null}], ""bootstrap"": ""Cafe to collapse, trapping people inside.\n\nQuestion: Who or what exploded?\nAnswer: bomb\n\nQuestion: When did the explosion occur?\nAnswer: on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period\n\nQuestion: Where was the explosion?\nAnswer: at the entrance to the building\n\nQuestion: How many people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion?\nAnswer: More than 300 people\n\nQuestion: What was the result of the explosion?\nAnswer: significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed.

Azamat Tazhayakov, a foreign student from Kazakhstan, was found guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice in Boston. Prosecutors said three days after April 15, 2013, <trigger id='trigger-4'>bombing</trigger>, 20-year-old Tazhayakov and another college friend removed Tzarnaev's backpack from his dormitory room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. The bag contained altered fireworks the friends threw away. Tazhayakov faces up to 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge and a maximum of five years in jail on the conspiracy charge. His sentencing is scheduled for October 16. Twin bombs <trigger id='trigger-5'>exploded</trigger> near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, <trigger id='trigger-6'>killing</trigger> three people and <trigger id='trigger-7'>injuring</trigger> more than 260 others. Police say that two ethnic Chechen brothers who had lived in the United States for a decade, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried the bombs in backpacks to the Boston street near the finish line before <trigger id='trigger-8'>detonating</trigger> them. Days later, Tamerlan was <trigger id='trigger-9'>killed</trigger> in a gun battle with police and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Authorities say he left a hand-scrawled confession inside the boat that said the <trigger id='trigger-10'>bombings</trigger> were retaliation for the U.
