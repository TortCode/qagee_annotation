"A settlement has been reached in a $1-million lawsuit filed by a taxi driver accusing police of negligence after he got caught up in the August 2016 take-down of ISIS-sympathizer Aaron Driver. READ MORE: FBI agent whose tip thwarted 2016 ISIS <trigger index='0'> attack </trigger> in Ontario says he was glad to help Terry Duffield was <trigger index='1'> injured </trigger> when Driver <trigger index='2'> detonated </trigger> a homemade explosive in the back of his cab in August 2016. “I have to be very careful because there is an agreement to not disclose any of the terms of the settlement,” Duffield’s lawyer Kevin Egan told 980 CFPL. “The statement of claim, I guess, speaks for itself in regard to what we alleged.” WATCH: Ontario taxi driver files $1M lawsuit against police 2: 18 Ontario taxi driver files $1M lawsuit against police Ontario taxi driver files $1M lawsuit against police That statement of claim, which Global News obtained a copy of in late March 2018, said police had more than enough time to intervene before Driver got into Duffield’s taxi. The Attorney General of Canada, the Ontario government, Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service and London Police Service were named as defendants. Story continues below advertisement On the morning of Aug. 10, 2016, U. S. authorities notified the RCMP they had detected a so-called martyrdom video in which a Canadian man said he was about to conduct an attack. The RCMP identified the man in the video as Driver and a tactical team surrounded his house in Strathroy. At 3: 45 p. m. , Driver called for a cab to take him to Citi Plaza in London. The claim alleged that despite the police presence, Duffield was not stopped from pulling into Driver’s driveway. Driver then came out of the house and got into the back seat of the cab. “When the SWAT team approached the vehicle, [Duffield] turned to Mr. Driver and said, ‘ I think they’re here to talk to you’and he leaned over to get his cigarettes, it’s a bench seat in the front of the taxicab, as he put his head down below the bench seat, the bomb <trigger index='3'> went </trigger> off.” Story continues below advertisement The inside of the cab where Aaron Driver <trigger index='4'> detonated </trigger> an explosive device on Aug. 10, 2016. Handout / RCMP Egan said Duffield had a preexisting back injury and the bomb blast triggered recurring pain. He also noted that his client was psychologically impacted by the event and is no longer able to work as a taxi driver. “He did try it. Got in a vehicle, turned the key on and started to shake and sweat and got out of the vehicle and vomited,” said Egan. Tweet This “He was so traumatized by the event. He realized that any time any potential passenger was approaching the vehicle with a package he would be hyper-vigilant about that and just couldn’t handle it emotionally.” Details of the settlement will not be made public, but Egan noted that no amount of money can properly compensate someone for physical or psychological injuries, but “is the best we can do in the circumstance.” He also noted that, while he was unwilling to disclose too much of Duffield’s personal health, he has received some counselling and is “coping better now than he was then.” Story continues below advertisement–with files from Stewart Bell and Andrew Russell.

"Amid speculation that President Bush is reconsidering what will constitute""regime change in Iraq,""one thing should be clear: Saddam Hussein's willingness to""change""his attitude towards permitting the resumption of intrusive on-site U. N. weapons <trigger index='0'> inspections </trigger> will not, in fact, eliminate the danger posed by him and his ruling clique. Indeed, what would be, at best, an ephemeral attitudinal adjustment on Saddam's part would probably not even diminish meaningfully the threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. After all, were Saddam--against all odds and past practice--actually to cooperate with the U. N. inspectors and assist in the complete elimination of his chemical and biological arsenals, he could resume covertly stockpiling them again in as little as six-months time. That period could be still shorter if he were to be rewarded for his""cooperation""by the elimination of international economic and trade sanctions against Iraq. A news item published in the London Evening Standard last Monday provides, however, an important reminder of why the United States cannot safely accept any substitute for the toppling of Saddam's regime. Specifically, it summarizes evidence implicating Saddam Hussein in one or more deadly acts of terror against the United States, specifically the Oklahoma City <trigger index='1'> bombing </trigger>. The Standard article draws on investigative reporting and forensic analysis into the Oklahoma City bombing performed over the past seven years by an intrepid and tenacious former TV journalist, Jayna Davis. She offers compelling, if circumstantial, indications that Iraqi operatives helped to plot, prepare and execute murderous <trigger index='2'> attacks </trigger> in Oklahoma City (and perhaps against other targets in the United States). For example, Ms. Davis has identified a man whose photo matches that of a""John Doe #2""sought immediately after the Murrah Building <trigger index='3'> attack </trigger>. He appears to be a Palestinian by the name of Hussain Hashem Al Hussaini, who sported a tatoo suggesting he had served in Saddam's elite Republican Guard. According to Davis'evidence, witnesses put Al Hussaini in the company of confessed bomber Timothy McVeigh a few days before the <trigger index='4'> attack </trigger> and near the site immediately beforehand. Ms. Davis has also found witnesses who say McVeigh and his convicted co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had <trigger index='5'> consorted </trigger> with former Iraqi soldiers. Some of these former soldiers worked for a Palestinian who owned a truck very like one sought after the <trigger index='6'> attack </trigger>. These soldiers reportedly were absent from work on the day of the <trigger index='7'> bombing </trigger> and were seen celebrating after it occurred. It strains credulity that all of these dots are not connected. What is more, Ms. Davis'evidence appears consistent with findings by another investigator, Dr. Laurie Mylroie, who has devoted years of effort to the pursuit of Iraqi connections to the earlier World Trade Center <trigger index='8'> bombing </trigger>. Like Ms. Davis, Dr. Mylroie concludes that Saddam's modus operandi is to employ cut-outs to cover his tracks. According to this thesis, the first attempt aimed at destroying the Twin Towers was not exclusively accomplished by followers of a blind Egyptian sheik with ties to Iran. This conclusion was actually a bonus for Hussein, because it vectored blame at Iran, his most formidable enemy and neighbor. Similarly, Oklahoma City was not, as prosecutors claimed, simply the homegrown handiwork of two violently disaffected U. S. citizens. And Sept. 11 was not the product solely of Usama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. In each of these cases, there is reason to believe that Saddam Hussein and his minions played some role in the <trigger index='9'> murder </trigger> of Americans. To be sure, it is not exactly news that Ms. Davis has concluded that Iraqi operatives were <trigger index='10'> involved </trigger> in Oklahoma City. What is news is that, according to the Evening Standard, the Bush Justice Department has apparently, finally begun to take a serious interest in Ms. Davis'evidence. Such evidence simply serves strongly to reinforce a reality of which President Bush has long and repeatedly warned: We will enjoy no relief from Saddam's <trigger index='11'> predations </trigger> unless and until he and his ilk are removed from power in Iraq. The memory of those Americans who have already been <trigger index='12'> murdered </trigger> by the Butcher of Baghdad and his co-conspirators will be besmirched--and the fate of untold numbers of their countrymen recklessly jeopardized--if a temporary adjustment to Saddam's behavior on <trigger index='13'> inspections </trigger> were to be confused with, and allowed to substitute for, the needed elimination of his regime.

"Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, has survived an apparent and–if true–audacious assassination attempt when, according to official reports, drones loaded with explosives <trigger index='1'> flew </trigger> towards the president while he was <trigger index='2'> speaking </trigger> at a military parade in Caracas. But many are now wondering: who could have been behind the <trigger index='3'> attack </trigger>? Foreign powers According to Maduro, the plot was concocted by an international cabal of rightwing schemers. He claimed the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, was “behind the attack” , supported by a network of plotters and financiers based in Florida, adding that a group of hired assassins had already been captured. Maduro, whose country is in economic and political turmoil, with inflation predicted to reach 1m% this year, has long accused the international community of waging economic war on him. He regularly lambasts the US as “imperialist” and says it is out to destroy socialism while taking over Venezuela’s oil–of which it has the largest reserves in the world. The opposition within Venezuela is also a regular target. Maduro claims it wants to undo the social reforms brought about by previous president Hugo Chávez, the charismatic revolutionary who died in 2013. Maduro has <trigger index='4'> jailed </trigger> and sidelined many opposition activists, regularly accusing them of plotting to overthrow him. It is this conspiracy that Maduro claims will be unearthed in an ongoing investigation. Rightwing rebels No one has claimed responsibility for the alleged assassination attempt outright, though one group–Soldiers Franelas–suggested involvement in a tweet. “We have shown [the government] is vulnerable,” the group said. “[The attack] wasn’t achieved today but it is just a matter of time [until it is].” Little is known about Soldiers Franelas beyond their Twitter presence, where the group regularly posts anti-Maduro tweets. La operación era sobrevolar 2 drones cargados con C4 el objetivo el palco presidencial, francotiradores de la guardia de honor derribaron los drones antes de llegar al objetivo. Demostramos que son vulnerables, no se logró hoy pero es cuestión de tiempo. #MilitaresPatriotas pic. twitter. com / teIEwygN3S — Soldados de Franelas (@ soldadoDfranela) August 4, 2018 The episode on Saturday reminded many in Venezuela of a similar incident last year when Óscar Pérez, a rogue police officer, <trigger index='5'> launched </trigger> grenades from a stolen helicopter at government buildings in Caracas. Pérez was <trigger index='6'> killed </trigger> in a <trigger index='7'> shootout </trigger> six months later. Some analysts suspect Soldiers Franelas of involvement in that incident. A hoax Some observers are suspicious of Maduro’s account of events, saying it seems a little too neat in a country where the government has long twisted the truth to its own ends. “The official ‘ investigation’of today’s alleged assassination attempt against president Maduro takes the usual course: begin with the conclusions and work backwards,” Phil Gunson, a consultant with non-profit Crisis Group, tweeted on Saturday evening. “In a country where 98% of <trigger index='0'> crime </trigger> goes unpunished, government sleuths resolve this kind of case in a matter of hours.” He will use it to concentrate power, whoever did this David Smilde Firefighters <trigger index='8'> interviewed </trigger> by the Associated Press claimed that the bangs heard were caused by a gas tank <trigger index='10'> explosion </trigger> in a nearby apartment. Some local journalists have backed up the claim, posting photos on Twitter of smoke billowing from the Residancias Don Eduardo apartment building on the street where the <trigger index='9'> attack </trigger> took place.
