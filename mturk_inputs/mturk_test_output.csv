wiki_mass_car_bombings_1_news_8,"The Taliban <trigger id='trigger-0'>killed</trigger> more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.""We have information that 126 people have been <trigger id='trigger-2'>killed</trigger> in the <trigger id='trigger-1'>explosion</trigger> inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,""said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said <trigger id='trigger-3'>the</trigger> assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and <trigger id='trigger-4'>detonated</trigger> the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province. Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and <trigger id='trigger-5'>shot</trigger> at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes. Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U. S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications. A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were <trigger id='trigger-6'>killed</trigger> in the complex <trigger id='trigger-16'>attack</trigger>.""I have <trigger id='trigger-13'>been</trigger> in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were <trigger id='trigger-12'>killed</trigger> in the big explosion,""the former provincial official said. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he <trigger id='trigger-7'>saw</trigger> bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.""Many more were killed. Several bodies were <trigger id='trigger-14'>transported</trigger> to Kabul city and many injured were <trigger id='trigger-15'>transferred</trigger> to hospitals in Kabul,""said Hotak, adding that""the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.""""The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,""he said. Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll. Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.""I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,""said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul. A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack. Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit. President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the""enemies of the country""had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr.""They <trigger id='trigger-23'>killed</trigger> and <trigger id='trigger-24'>wounded</trigger> a number of our beloved and honest sons.""Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani. Meanwhile, the Taliban said it <trigger id='trigger-21'>met</trigger> with U. S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year <trigger id='trigger-22'>war</trigger>. The U. S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.""Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,""Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement. Taliban representatives have met several times with U. S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and""unilaterally""adding new subjects. The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government--despite U. S. pleas--which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington. In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28, 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack. Last week, Taliban fighters <trigger id='trigger-20'>set</trigger> off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound <trigger id='trigger-19'>killing</trigger> at least five people and <trigger id='trigger-18'>wounding</trigger> more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul. On Sunday, a <trigger id='trigger-8'>suicide</trigger> bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen <trigger id='trigger-10'>dead</trigger> and another 10 <trigger id='trigger-9'>wounded</trigger>. The Taliban <trigger id='trigger-11'>bombing</trigger> targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed. The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U. S. troops have increased operations against the militants'field commanders. Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are <trigger id='trigger-17'>killed</trigger> every day in attacks and clashes. This is while the U. S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14, 000 U. S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7, 500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U. S. government research organization. In a report on Sunday, RAND said that if the U. S. considers""an early and complete or near-complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement,""it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country. If the withdrawal does take place, RAND noted,""the major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women's emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back throughout the country.""","[{""event_id"": ""wiki_mass_car_bombings_1_news_8-E1"", ""text"": ""killed"", ""offset"": 2, ""template"": ""[Victim] died at [Place] place from

scenario_en_kairos_68,"Thank you, your Honor, for giving me an opportunity to speak. I would like to begin in the name of Allah, the exalted and glorious, the most gracious, the most merciful, “Allah” among the most beautiful names. Any act that does not begin in the name of God is separate from goodness. This is the blessed month of Ramadan, and it is the month of mercy from Allah to his creation, a month to ask forgiveness of Allah and of his creation, a month to express gratitude to Allah and to his creation. It’s the month of reconciliation, a month of patience, a month during which hearts change. Indeed, a month of many blessings. The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said if you have not thanked the people, you have not thanked God. So I would like to first thank my attorneys, those who sit at this table, the table behind me, and many more behind the scenes. They have done much good for me, for my family. They made my life the last two years very easy. I cherish their company. They’re lovely companions. I thank you. Advertisement I would like to thank those who took time out of their daily lives to come and testify on my behalf despite the pressure. I’d like to thank the jury for their service, and the Court. The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said that if you do not--if you are not merciful to Allah’s creation, Allah will not be merciful to you, so I’d like to now apologize to the victims, to the survivors. Advertisement Immediately after the <trigger id='trigger-0'>bombing</trigger>, which I am guilty of--if there’s any lingering doubt about that, let there be no more. I did do it along with my brother--I learned of some of the victims. I learned their names, their faces, their age. And throughout this trial more of those victims were given names, more of those victims had faces, and they had burdened souls. Now, all those who got up on that witness stand and that podium related to us--to me--I was listening--the suffering that was and the hardship that still is, with strength and with patience and with dignity. Now, Allah says in the Qur’an that no soul is burdened with more than it can bear, and you told us just how unbearable it was, how horrendous it was, this thing I put you through. And I know that you kept that much. I know that there isn’t enough time in the day for you to have related to us everything. I also wish that far more people had a chance to get up there, but I took them from you. Now, I am sorry for the lives that I’ve taken, for the suffering that I’ve caused you, for the damage that I’ve done. Irreparable damage. Now, I am a Muslim. My religion is Islam. The God I worship, besides whom there is no other God, is Allah. And I prayed for Allah to bestow his mercy upon the deceased, those affected in the bombing and their families. Allah says in the Qur’an that with every hardship there is relief. I pray for your relief, for your healing, for your well-being, for your strength. Advertisement I ask Allah to have mercy upon me and my brother and my family. I ask Allah to bestow his mercy upon those present here today. And Allah knows best those deserving of his mercy. And I ask Allah to have mercy upon the ummah of Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Amin. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Thank you. Milton J.

53_VOA_EN_NW_2015.06.24.2835606,"Boston Marathon Bomber Apologizes to Survivors BOSTON — Moments before a federal judge <trigger id='trigger-0'>sentenced</trigger> him to <trigger id='trigger-1'>death</trigger>, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose to his feet Wednesday and apologized to the victims and their loved ones for the first time.""I pray for your relief, for your healing,''he said. Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21-year-old ethnic Chechen said,""I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the <trigger id='trigger-2'>damage</trigger> that I've done — irreparable <trigger id='trigger-3'>damage</trigger>.''It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court. After Tsarnaev finished, U. S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the <trigger id='trigger-5'>death</trigger> <trigger id='trigger-4'>sentence</trigger> on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously. In May, after a 12-week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of <trigger id='trigger-6'>killing</trigger> three people and <trigger id='trigger-7'>injuring</trigger> 264 in the April 15, 2013, <trigger id='trigger-8'>bombing</trigger> at the world-renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, <trigger id='trigger-9'>set</trigger> off two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line. Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal <trigger id='trigger-10'>shooting</trigger> of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was <trigger id='trigger-11'>killed</trigger> during the getaway. Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other <trigger id='trigger-12'>charges</trigger> against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a <trigger id='trigger-14'>death</trigger> <trigger id='trigger-13'>sentence</trigger>. During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother. Victims speak out Before the <trigger id='trigger-15'>sentencing</trigger>, a somber-looking Tsarnaev, wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie, sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people — some victims, some survivors — gave impact statements. They lashed out at him for his “cowardly” and “disgusting” acts, and several called upon him to apologize, trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness. Tsarnaev, his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke, picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time, only occasionally looking at the speakers. Patricia Campbell, the mother of Krystle Campbell, 29, who was <trigger id='trigger-16'>killed</trigger> in the <trigger id='trigger-17'>attack</trigger>, was the first person to address the court. She looked across the room at Tsarnaev, seated about 20 feet away, and spoke directly to him. “What you did to my daughter is disgusting,” she said. “I don't know what to say to you. I think the jury did the right thing.” Krystle Campbell's best friend, Karen Rand McWatters, who <trigger id='trigger-24'>lost</trigger> a leg in the <trigger id='trigger-18'>attack</trigger>, said Tsarnaev""can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing.” In a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in, Tsarnaev said the <trigger id='trigger-19'>attack</trigger> was retaliation against the U. S. for its wars in Muslim countries. McWatters urged Tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from <trigger id='trigger-20'>killing</trigger> people in similar <trigger id='trigger-21'>attacks</trigger>. “You can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret,” she said. Rebekah Gregory, a Texas woman who <trigger id='trigger-23'>lost</trigger> a leg in the <trigger id='trigger-22'>bombing</trigger>, defiantly told Tsarnaev she was not his victim. “While your intention was to destroy America, what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite — you've unified us,” she said.""We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement?”'He is a leech'Several victims condemned Tsarnaev for coming to the U. S. as an immigrant from Russia, enjoying the benefits of living here and then <trigger id='trigger-25'>attacking</trigger> American citizens. “He is a leech, abusing the privilege of American freedom, and he spit in the face of the American dream,” said Jennifer Rogers, an older sister of slain MIT Officer Sean Collier. Bill Richard, whose 8-year-old son, Martin, was the youngest person <trigger id='trigger-26'>killed</trigger> in the <trigger id='trigger-27'>bombing</trigger>, said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities. Instead, Richard said, “he chose hate. He chose <trigger id='trigger-28'>destruction</trigger>. He chose <trigger id='trigger-29'>death</trigger>. This is all on him.” Richard noted that his family would have preferred that Tsarnaev receive a life <trigger id='trigger-30'>sentence</trigger> so that he could have had “a lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day.” Richard said his family has chosen love, kindness and peace, adding: “That is what makes us different than him.” Fatima Tlisova of VOA's Russian service contributed to this report from Boston.

wiki_drone_strikes_0_news_1,"There were ten times more air <trigger id='trigger-0'>strikes</trigger> in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama’s presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush. Obama embraced the US drone programme, overseeing more <trigger id='trigger-1'>strikes</trigger> in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 <trigger id='trigger-2'>strikes</trigger>, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama’s two terms, compared to 57 <trigger id='trigger-3'>strikes</trigger> under Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were <trigger id='trigger-4'>killed</trigger> in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau. The use of drones aligned with Obama’s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism. The Obama administration has insisted that drone <trigger id='trigger-5'>strikes</trigger> are so “exceptionally surgical and precise” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “innocent men, women and children in danger” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau’s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case. The White House released long-awaited figures last July on the number of people <trigger id='trigger-6'>killed</trigger> in drone <trigger id='trigger-7'>strikes</trigger> between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US’s estimate of the number of civilians <trigger id='trigger-8'>killed</trigger>–between 64 and 116–contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher. That figure does not include <trigger id='trigger-9'>deaths</trigger> in active battlefields including Afghanistan–where US air <trigger id='trigger-10'>attacks</trigger> have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US <trigger id='trigger-11'>bombardment</trigger>, in an unreported war that saw 1, 337 weapons dropped last year alone–a 40% rise on 2015. Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations (UN) reporting at least 85 <trigger id='trigger-12'>deaths</trigger> in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian <trigger id='trigger-13'>deaths</trigger> during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015. Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama’s first term. The pace of <trigger id='trigger-14'>attacks</trigger> had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush’s term, after four years pocked by occasional <trigger id='trigger-17'>strikes</trigger>. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone <trigger id='trigger-16'>strikes</trigger> than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 <trigger id='trigger-15'>strikes</trigger> in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.

wiki_ied_bombings_10,"On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb <trigger id='trigger-0'>exploded</trigger> without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were <trigger id='trigger-1'>injured</trigger>, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers <trigger id='trigger-11'>lost</trigger> their legs as a result of the bombing. == Background == In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army <trigger id='trigger-22'>agreed</trigger> to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven""incident centres""were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to <trigger id='trigger-17'>monitor</trigger> the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun <trigger id='trigger-2'>attacks</trigger> in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an <trigger id='trigger-12'>assassination</trigger> attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers <trigger id='trigger-13'>threw</trigger> a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974. == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang <trigger id='trigger-16'>planted</trigger> a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit <trigger id='trigger-18'>placed</trigger> the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb <trigger id='trigger-3'>exploded</trigger> at 9: 20, <trigger id='trigger-4'>injuring</trigger> 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the <trigger id='trigger-14'>injuries</trigger> were very serious, with at least three soldiers <trigger id='trigger-15'>losing</trigger> limbs. The blast <trigger id='trigger-7'>blew</trigger> the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit <trigger id='trigger-5'>exploded</trigger> a bomb in Oxford Street, <trigger id='trigger-6'>injuring</trigger> several people. == Aftermath == One of the police officers in <trigger id='trigger-19'>charge</trigger> of the investigation into the bombing described it as a""carbon copy""of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their <trigger id='trigger-20'>sentences</trigger>. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were <trigger id='trigger-21'>caught</trigger> at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the <trigger id='trigger-8'>deaths</trigger> of nearly 20 people, <trigger id='trigger-9'>injured</trigger> hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of <trigger id='trigger-10'>damage</trigger> to property. == See also == * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970–79) == References ==","[{""event_id"": ""wiki_ied_bombings_10-E1"", ""text"": ""exploded"", ""offset"": 8, ""template"": ""[Attacker] detonated or exploded [ExplosiveDevice] explosive device using [Instrument] to attack [Target] target at [Place] place"", ""role_text_map"": [{""role"": ""Attacker"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""Target"", ""text"": ""Caterham Arms public house""}, {""role"": ""Instrument"", ""text"": null}, {""role"": ""ExplosiveDevice"", ""text"": ""bomb""}, {""role"": ""Place"", ""text"": ""Caterham""}], ""bootstrap"": ""Question: When did the bombing occur?\nAnswer: 27 August 1975\n\nQuestion: Who was responsible for the bombing?\nAnswer: Provisional IRA\n\nQuestion: Where did the bombing occur?\nAnswer: Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England\n\nQuestion: What was the result of the bombing?\nAnswer: 33 people were injured, some severely.

backpack_ied_13,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that there is “no evidence of an international terrorism connection” in the explosion in Chelsea, though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror. AD “It depends on your definition of terrorism,” Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-6'>said</trigger>. “A bomb <trigger id='trigger-7'>exploding</trigger> in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it’s not linked to international terrorism. In other words, we find no ISIS connections.” AD He said later: “This is the nightmare scenario.” Not long after the blast, police said they had <trigger id='trigger-8'>found</trigger> another possible explosive device just blocks away. This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing <trigger id='trigger-0'>investigation</trigger>. Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. The bomb squad safely <trigger id='trigger-9'>removed</trigger> the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday. Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) <trigger id='trigger-10'>said</trigger> Sunday that the explosion was “intentional,” but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages. “We know there was a bombing,” de Blasio <trigger id='trigger-11'>said</trigger>. “We know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this.” AD AD He also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible <trigger id='trigger-1'>threat</trigger> against New York from any terrorist group. The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast. “We will look at individuals. We will look at associations. We will look at social media,” William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, <trigger id='trigger-12'>said</trigger>. “Until we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [as to motivation],” DeBlasio <trigger id='trigger-13'>said</trigger>. “Let the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions.” Police Commissioner James O’Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence. AD “We did find some components indicative of an IED … that went off intentionally,” O’Neill <trigger id='trigger-14'>said</trigger>. Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast. AD The New York Police Department’s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While O’Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast: Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p. m. that they had <trigger id='trigger-15'>found</trigger> the “possible secondary device” a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues. Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that “there is a possible explosive” in the area. AD Not long after midnight, police <trigger id='trigger-16'>said</trigger> in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows “until we clear the suspicious package,” although officers did not fully evacuate the area. AD According to the Associated Press, the second device was <trigger id='trigger-17'>removed</trigger> with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx. O’Neill said Sunday that two “very dedicated” former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night. In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street. Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O’Neill <trigger id='trigger-18'>said</trigger>. AD Reports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm — the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12: 30 a. m. Sunday. The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors. AD Authorities have <trigger id='trigger-19'>said</trigger> they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate. On Sunday, Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-20'>said</trigger> the “bombs” in Chelsea “appear to be different” from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment. He <trigger id='trigger-21'>said</trigger> the devices in New Jersey were “pipe bombs,” and those in Chelsea were not. Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-22'>said</trigger> agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey. AD Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-23'>said</trigger> officials “have no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat,” though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1, 000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways “just to err on the side of caution.” AD Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-24'>said</trigger> the blast in Chelsea “caused significant property damage,” though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe. He <trigger id='trigger-25'>said</trigger> law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible. “Whoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice,” Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-26'>said</trigger>. The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues <trigger id='trigger-27'>occurred</trigger> about 8: 30 p. m. police said. Several of those <trigger id='trigger-2'>injured</trigger> were <trigger id='trigger-28'>brought</trigger> to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, <trigger id='trigger-29'>posted</trigger> on Twitter. AD All victims were <trigger id='trigger-30'>treated</trigger> and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo <trigger id='trigger-31'>said</trigger>. A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which <trigger id='trigger-32'>treated</trigger> nine of the victims, <trigger id='trigger-33'>said</trigger> patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body. Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients’injuries from the explosion. AD Photos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds — as well as a large law enforcement presence — in the area near where the explosion occurred. Soleil Filomena, 64, was leaving a convenience store at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street when she heard the explosion. “It was so loud it just went through my whole body,” she said. “People started running up 23rd Street, and I started running with them.” AD Filomena said she saw a “big black cloud in the sky.” After the explosion, she said her “ear was ringing for 15 minutes.” When Keith Salomon of Delaware felt the explosion, he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast. His chair and table shook, he <trigger id='trigger-34'>said</trigger>, and he saw people being taken away in ambulances. “We didn’t know what it was and so, at first, we just kept eating,” <trigger id='trigger-35'>said</trigger> Salomon, 52, who was visiting his son in the city. “But then we realized something was wrong.” Others did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath. When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p. m. , he saw people running and screaming. AD “I didn’t know what was going on, but everyone looked so panicked. I started running. too,” said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014. Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie “Beauty and the Beast” and saw the flashing lights. One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting. President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday. Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what’s going on,” <trigger id='trigger-36'>said</trigger> Trump shortly after getting off of his plane. His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion. Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to “know the facts” before drawing conclusions about such incidents. Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet. Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night. On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area. The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday. This annual <trigger id='trigger-3'>meeting</trigger> — held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea — is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams. The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker. They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media — “all the logical leads,” the official said. The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St. Cloud mall before he was <trigger id='trigger-4'>killed</trigger> by an off-duty police officer. On Sunday, an ISIS-linked news agency <trigger id='trigger-37'>claimed</trigger> the mall attacker was “a soldier of the Islamic State.” An FBI spokesman <trigger id='trigger-38'>said</trigger> in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the <trigger id='trigger-5'>stabbings</trigger> were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota. Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1-800-577-TIPS. Berman and Wang reported from Washington.

backpack_ied_20,"WASHINGTON — The threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from Iraq to Israel and Afghanistan and Russia. But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, such street-level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil. US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk <trigger id='trigger-0'>bombing</trigger> could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland. Advertisement “We’ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn’t happened here, not like this. Until yesterday,’’said a senior homeland security official in Washington. The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast <trigger id='trigger-1'>attacks</trigger> using “improvised explosive devices,’’or IEDs. One of the bombs used in a foiled <trigger id='trigger-2'>attack</trigger> in New York’s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker. A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple <trigger id='trigger-3'>attacks</trigger> in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon <trigger id='trigger-4'>attack</trigger> indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB’s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage. That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people. IED’s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry. They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles. Advertisement No one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that <trigger id='trigger-5'>killed</trigger> three people and <trigger id='trigger-6'>injured</trigger> more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line. A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well-known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years, The Pakistani Taliban also <trigger id='trigger-8'>said</trigger> in a statement it was not responsible for the <trigger id='trigger-7'>attack</trigger>, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York’s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for. But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so-called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks. In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so-called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday. “The threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them,’’according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26. “A whole-of-government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter-IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U. S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent.’’Advertisement The 2010 warning from the FBI and Homeland Security said “terrorists can exploit the innocuous appearance of easily transportable items such as pressure cookers to conceal IED components. Placed carefully, such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack.’’ “Alertness and quick reaction to discovery of such concealment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack,’’the warning continued. Potential indicators of a pressure cooker configured as an IED include protruding wires or fuses, unusual smells such as chemical odors, and wetness or unusual stains on a container. A magazine published during the last decade by Al Qaeda provided bomb-making tips that included using pressure cookers. Instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites, including one site that bills itself as an “anarchist cookbook.’’","[{""event_id"": ""backpack_ied_20-E1"", ""text"":

20_VOA_EN_NW_2016.11.17.3601570,"Accused New York City Bomber Pleads Not Guilty Accused New York bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal <trigger id='trigger-0'>charges</trigger> that he <trigger id='trigger-1'>set</trigger> off an explosive device in September on a crowded city street, <trigger id='trigger-2'>injuring</trigger> 30 people. Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief <trigger id='trigger-3'>hearing</trigger>. He suffered serious <trigger id='trigger-4'>injuries</trigger> in a shootout with police two days after the <trigger id='trigger-19'>bombing</trigger>. He spoke only once, when U. S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight-count indictment filed on Wednesday.""Yes, sir,""Rahimi said. Prosecutors have accused the Afghan-born U. S. citizen of <trigger id='trigger-5'>setting</trigger> off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not <trigger id='trigger-6'>kill</trigger> anyone but <trigger id='trigger-7'>hurt</trigger> 30 people. The <trigger id='trigger-8'>attack</trigger> came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi <trigger id='trigger-9'>went</trigger> off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not <trigger id='trigger-10'>injure</trigger> anyone. Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not <trigger id='trigger-11'>go</trigger> off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces <trigger id='trigger-12'>charges</trigger> from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey. He was <trigger id='trigger-13'>captured</trigger> after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot <trigger id='trigger-14'>wounds</trigger>, delaying the filing of federal <trigger id='trigger-15'>charges</trigger> and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the <trigger id='trigger-20'>bombings</trigger>, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device <trigger id='trigger-16'>went</trigger> off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street. He also said the government has records showing Rahimi <trigger id='trigger-17'>purchased</trigger> bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs. Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the""late winter""or""early spring,""saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date. Rahimi's court-appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the <trigger id='trigger-18'>hearing</trigger>.

38_VOA_EN_NW_2013.04.24.1647602,"Bombing Suspects'Parents Questioned in Dagestan U. S. investigators have questioned the parents of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects in the Russian republic of Dagestan, as they try to determine what might have influenced their sons in the months before the April 15 attack. The American authorities, working with Russian security forces, interviewed both parents Tuesday night and called back the suspects'mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, for more questioning on Wednesday. The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, might have had with Islamic extremists during a six-month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year. U. S. lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies. Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia. Tamerlan Tsarnaev <trigger id='trigger-0'>died</trigger> after a shootout with police last Thursday, while his younger brother Dzhokhar was <trigger id='trigger-1'>captured</trigger> a day later. Meanwhile, in Boston, authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street, the city thoroughfare where the <trigger id='trigger-2'>explosions</trigger> occurred near the finish line of the race. Later, several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier, who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers <trigger id='trigger-3'>shot</trigger> to death three days after the bombings. Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan's trip, but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned. The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia's request, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time. The 19-year-old Dzhokhar has been <trigger id='trigger-4'>charged</trigger> with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital. U. S. officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self-radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network. The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys. The brothers allegedly <trigger id='trigger-5'>set</trigger> off two bombs alongside the Boston Marathon course, <trigger id='trigger-6'>killing</trigger> three people and <trigger id='trigger-7'>injuring</trigger> 264. At least 14 of the wounded lost legs in the blasts.

Feb. 8, 2013 Tamerlan Tsarnaev used his credit card to <trigger id='trigger-12'>make</trigger> an online purchase of a remote-controlled car set, batteries, and a transmitter and receiver from NitroRCX. com. Prosecutors said these items were used to help remotely-detonate the bombs February, 2013 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <trigger id='trigger-21'>visits</trigger> Silva and <trigger id='trigger-17'>borrows</trigger> the Ruger pistol — the gun that was later used to <trigger id='trigger-24'>kill</trigger> MIT police officer Sean Collier and during the <trigger id='trigger-25'>shootout</trigger> with police in Watertown. March 11, 2013 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev creates a secret Twitter account, @ Al-FirdausiA, with the user name Ghuraba and posted six Tweets in three days. The first post on March 11, 2013 reads:""I want the highest levels of Jannah, I want to be able to see Allah every single day for that is the best of pleasures.""He also maintains his original Twitter account that includes mostly typical teenage postings, but some that could be signs of growing radicalization.

April 14, 2013 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev opens a prepaid cellphone account under the name Jahar Tsarni. He would use this phone while at the Boston Marathon the next day. On the same day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev <trigger id='trigger-6'>buys</trigger> two backpacks at a Target in Watertown that were used to carry the bombs.

23_VOA_EN_NW_2015.11.24.3071320,"Thai Authorities <trigger id='trigger-0'>Indict</trigger> 2 Over August Shrine <trigger id='trigger-1'>Attack</trigger> A Bangkok military court has <trigger id='trigger-2'>indicted</trigger> two men accused of carrying out the August 17 <trigger id='trigger-3'>bombing</trigger> at a popular shrine that <trigger id='trigger-4'>killed</trigger> 20 people. The court on Tuesday <trigger id='trigger-5'>indicted</trigger> Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the <trigger id='trigger-6'>blast</trigger>, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder. Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism. Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the <trigger id='trigger-38'>bombing</trigger> but only Bilal and Mieraili have been <trigger id='trigger-7'>detained</trigger>. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their <trigger id='trigger-8'>arrests</trigger> in late August and early September. Thai officials have <trigger id='trigger-9'>said</trigger> the <trigger id='trigger-10'>blast</trigger> was carried out by a people-smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation. The August 17 <trigger id='trigger-11'>blast</trigger> at the Erawan Shrine-a popular tourist destination-was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people <trigger id='trigger-12'>dead</trigger> and more than 120 <trigger id='trigger-13'>injured</trigger>. Of the <trigger id='trigger-14'>dead</trigger>, 14 were tourists. The <trigger id='trigger-15'>attack</trigger> shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have <trigger id='trigger-39'>declined</trigger> to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry. Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon <trigger id='trigger-18'>claimed</trigger> success with a series of <trigger id='trigger-17'>raids</trigger> and two <trigger id='trigger-16'>arrests</trigger>. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others. The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the <trigger id='trigger-19'>indictments</trigger> took place before the two suspects <trigger id='trigger-20'>arrived</trigger>, <trigger id='trigger-40'>said</trigger> defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai. Doubts about motive Early speculation about the <trigger id='trigger-21'>bombing</trigger> had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly <trigger id='trigger-22'>repatriated</trigger> more than 100 Uighurs to China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the <trigger id='trigger-23'>bombing</trigger>. But Thai officials <trigger id='trigger-24'>reject</trigger> any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human-smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police <trigger id='trigger-26'>explanation</trigger> on the shrine <trigger id='trigger-25'>attack</trigger> has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation. The two suspects are being <trigger id='trigger-27'>tried</trigger> at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “national security” have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government. Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang <trigger id='trigger-28'>said</trigger> before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed-circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions. Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T-shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he <trigger id='trigger-29'>left</trigger> the shrine just minutes before the <trigger id='trigger-30'>blast</trigger> occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people. Police believe that Bilal is the yellow-shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have <trigger id='trigger-31'>detonated</trigger> the bomb. Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was <trigger id='trigger-32'>arrested</trigger> Aug. 29. He was <trigger id='trigger-33'>arrested</trigger> at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok. Yusufu was <trigger id='trigger-34'>arrested</trigger> Sept. 1 near the Thai-Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang. Police <trigger id='trigger-35'>said</trigger> his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder. Police <trigger id='trigger-36'>said</trigger> they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive. He <trigger id='trigger-37'>says</trigger> Bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to Turkey would be expedited. Some material for this report came from AP.

K0C041O37,"Analysis backs claim drones were used to <trigger id='trigger-0'>attack</trigger> Venezuela’s president Analysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an <trigger id='trigger-1'>attack</trigger> on the president of Venezuela this weekend. The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an <trigger id='trigger-2'>attempt</trigger> had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives. The president had been giving a <trigger id='trigger-12'>speech</trigger> which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred. Initial video from a state-owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera. But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions. AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat. Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building. Bellingcat has carried out an <trigger id='trigger-3'>analysis</trigger> of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro’s speech, and using frame-by-frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up. The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters. DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work — with a U. S. price tag of around $5, 000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially (for demolition purposes) at a cost of around $30. Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government’s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors. It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed. Venezuela’s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also <trigger id='trigger-13'>claimed</trigger> the government thwarted the attack using""special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors"", which""<trigger id='trigger-5'>disoriented</trigger>""the drone that <trigger id='trigger-4'>detonated</trigger> closest to the presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have. The second drone was said by Reverol to have""lost control""and <trigger id='trigger-6'>crashed</trigger> into a nearby building. Bellingcat <trigger id='trigger-14'>says</trigger> it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion. It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have <trigger id='trigger-9'>crashed</trigger>.""It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently <trigger id='trigger-8'>detonated</trigger>, creating the hole in the wall of this apartment, igniting a fire, and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [of the state TV broadcast of Maduro’s speech],""it further suggests. Here’s its conclusion: From the open sources of information available, it appears that an <trigger id='trigger-7'>attack</trigger> took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech. Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model. These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade. The first drone <trigger id='trigger-10'>detonated</trigger> somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties <trigger id='trigger-15'>announced</trigger> by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media. The second drone <trigger id='trigger-11'>crashed</trigger> and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described. It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself""Soldados de Franelas""(aka ‘ T-Shirt Soldiers’— a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t-shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity), suggesting it’s not clear from the group’s Twitter messages that they are""unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event"", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says""does not appear to be supported by the open source information available"".

wiki_mass_car_bombings_7_news_2,"A wave of <trigger id='trigger-0'>attacks</trigger> across Iraq on Monday <trigger id='trigger-1'>killed</trigger> 107 people in the country's deadliest day in more than two years after al-Qaida warned it would mount new attacks and sought to retake territory. Officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities, shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead-up to the start on Saturday of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. In Monday's deadliest attack--a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide <trigger id='trigger-2'>attack</trigger> targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji--at least 42 people were <trigger id='trigger-3'>killed</trigger> and 40 wounded, according to two medical officials.""I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside,""said 40-year-old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb.""We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off.""Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the <trigger id='trigger-4'>deaths</trigger> of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives. An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely <trigger id='trigger-5'>destroyed</trigger>, and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings. In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City <trigger id='trigger-6'>killed</trigger> at least 12 people and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said.""This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting,""said one elderly witness who declined to be identified. An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9: 30 am (0630 GMT) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted. Two other <trigger id='trigger-7'>explosions</trigger> in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded, while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah, just north of Baghdad, hurt nine people, officials said. Checkpoint shootings and bomb <trigger id='trigger-8'>blasts</trigger> in restive ethnically-mixed Diyala province killed 11 people and left 40 others wounded, security officials and doctor Ahmed Ibrahim from the main hospital in provincial capital Baquba said. Insurgents also launched <trigger id='trigger-9'>attacks</trigger> on a military base near the town of Dhuluiyah, <trigger id='trigger-10'>killing</trigger> at least 15 Iraqi soldiers and leaving two others <trigger id='trigger-11'>wounded</trigger>, according to two security officials. Two other attacks in the same province--a <trigger id='trigger-12'>shooting</trigger> at a checkpoint and a car bomb near a Shiite mosque--left three people dead and six wounded, officials said. Nine bomb <trigger id='trigger-13'>blasts</trigger>, some of them minutes apart, meanwhile killed seven people and wounded 29 in Kirkuk city and the eponymous province's towns of Dibis and Tuz Khurmatu. Three different attacks--a car bomb, a roadside <trigger id='trigger-14'>blast</trigger> and a shooting--in the main northern city of Mosul and the nearby town of Baaj left nine people <trigger id='trigger-15'>dead</trigger> and seven wounded, according to Iraqi army First Lieutenant Waad Mohammed and police Lieutenant Mohammed al-Juburi. A roadside bomb at a market in the center of the town of Diwaniyah, south of Baghdad, killed three people and left 25 hurt, provincial health chief Adnan Turki said. In the western town of Heet, a car bomb <trigger id='trigger-16'>exploded</trigger> near an army patrol, killing one soldier and wounding 10 others, according to an Iraqi army captain and doctor Abdulwahab al-Shammari from the town hospital. The attacks came a day after a spate of <trigger id='trigger-17'>bombings</trigger> across Iraq killed at least 17 people and wounded nearly 100 others. Monday's toll was the highest since May 10, 2010, when 110 people were killed. The latest violence comes after the country suffered a spike in unrest in June when at least 282 people were killed, according to an AFP tally based on figures supplied by officials and medics, although government figures said 131 Iraqis died. Although those figures are markedly lower than during the peak of Iraq's communal bloodshed from 2006 to 2008, attacks remain common. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attacks, but al-Qaida's front group in Iraq has warned in recent days that it seeks to retake territory in the country. The Islamic State of Iraq warned in an audio message posted on various jihadist forums that it would begin targeting judges and prosecutors, and appealed for the help of Sunni tribes in its quest to recapture territory it once held.""We are starting a new stage,""said the voice on the message, purportedly that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has been leader of the Islamic State of Iraq since May 2010.""The first priority in this is releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.""It was not possible to verify whether the voice was that of Baghdadi. The speaker added:""On the occasion of the beginning of the return of the state to the areas that we left, I urge you to carry out more efforts, and send your sons with the mujahedeen to defend your religion and obey God.""","[{""event_id"": ""wiki_mass_car_bombings_7_news_2-E1"", ""text"": ""attacks"", ""offset"": 3, ""template"": ""[Attacker] attacked [Target] using [Instrument] at [Place]

wiki_mass_car_bombings_0_news_9,"Cuba <trigger id='trigger-1'>sidesteps</trigger> Colombia’s <trigger id='trigger-0'>request</trigger> to extradite the rebels after Bogota blames the group for Thursday’s car bombing. Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army (ELN), who were in Havana for peace talks, after a deadly car <trigger id='trigger-2'>bombing</trigger> in Bogota was blamed on the group. Conservative President Ivan Duque <trigger id='trigger-3'>urged</trigger> Communist-ruled Cuba, a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process, to send home the ELN rebels in Havana. Cuba’s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks. On Friday, Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the <trigger id='trigger-5'>bombing</trigger> of a police academy in Bogota that <trigger id='trigger-4'>killed</trigger> 20 people as well as the attacker, dealing a big blow to the peace process. 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members, who are part of the group’s delegation to the Cuba talks. The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist-inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels. The police academy car bombing “was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [Cuba acting] to avoid justice being done” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima. Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to <trigger id='trigger-8'>protest</trigger> against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years. Last rebel group In November, Colombia <trigger id='trigger-6'>asked</trigger> Cuba to <trigger id='trigger-7'>capture</trigger> ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory. The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue. Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fighters. 190118182118648 With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country. True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN. Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets. The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of them for several years.

Kieran Conway, who was head of the IRA’s intelligence-gathering department in the 1970s, broke a 40-year silence by the organisation to make the admission. He admitted he was “appalled and ashamed” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for. He said the <trigger id='trigger-1'>attacks</trigger> on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the <trigger id='trigger-14'>death</trigger> of IRA bomber James McDade. At first he feared that the timing of the attacks-with very little warning-had been deliberate because “tempers were high” . But he was later <trigger id='trigger-15'>told</trigger> that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “a succession of phone boxes” which were out of order, significantly delaying the bomb-warning call. Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Listen to our recreation of the Birmingham pub bombings warning call-made to the Birmingham Post & Mail newsroom Conway, who makes the admissions in his new memoir, also revealed that soon after the bombings the IRA’s England Operational Commander and his adjutant “made it back home” to Dublin for an urgent de-brief and to assess the impact of the disaster as far as the terrorists were concerned. Birmingham pub <trigger id='trigger-2'>bombings</trigger>: Minute by minute-24 hours that changed our city forever Funding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings, which left 21 <trigger id='trigger-3'>dead</trigger> and almost 200 <trigger id='trigger-4'>injured</trigger>, including many <trigger id='trigger-5'>maimed</trigger> for life, cost them hugely in the propaganda war. And in an interview he confirmed that the IRA hierarchy in Dublin knew all along that the six Irishmen <trigger id='trigger-6'>arrested</trigger> for the explosions were innocent “from the get go, from the very start.” Now, Julie and Brian Hambleton, who lost their sister Maxine in the bombings and lead the city’s Justice4the21 campaign, called on West Midlands Police and David Cameron to take immediate action. Julie <trigger id='trigger-16'>said</trigger>: “I am expecting West Midlands Police Chief Constable Chris Sims and West Midlands Police Force to interview with Mr Conway with immediate effect. “And I hope that Mr Cameron, who a week ago told The House of Commons that the pub bombers must be found, takes note of this development and ensures that the police follow this through.” Brian <trigger id='trigger-17'>added</trigger>: “The police keep saying they won’t do anything because there is no fresh evidence. Well, here it is in black and white. It’s an admission. They have got to do something with this information.” The Birmingham pub <trigger id='trigger-7'>bombings</trigger>-The 28 numbers that add up to a cover-up, say campaigners Mr Conway, now a criminal lawyer in Dublin, <trigger id='trigger-18'>says</trigger> in the book that where off-duty soldiers were the targets of <trigger id='trigger-8'>bombings</trigger> “I had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space.” He <trigger id='trigger-19'>continued</trigger>: “The Birmingham bombs were another matter.""The bombings came after British police disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, a volunteer who had himself <trigger id='trigger-9'>died</trigger> in a premature explosion in England. “Tempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties–21 people were <trigger id='trigger-10'>killed</trigger> and a great many others <trigger id='trigger-11'>injured</trigger>.” “I was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing, which went against everything we claimed to stand for.” He <trigger id='trigger-20'>said</trigger> he told two other senior IRA figures, Dave O’Connell and Kevin Mallon “exactly what I thought” when they <trigger id='trigger-21'>met</trigger> up. “In fact, both men were themselves furious, fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the IRA but its immorality as well.” McDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA, <trigger id='trigger-22'>blew</trigger> himself up while trying to plant a bomb at Coventry Telephone exchange a week before the pub <trigger id='trigger-23'>bombings</trigger>. Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection. Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non-military targets was to give a 30-minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place. Read our docudrama minute-by-minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974 The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous <trigger id='trigger-24'>call</trigger> at 8. 11pm on November 21. The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town. The first bomb <trigger id='trigger-25'>destroyed</trigger> The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8. 27pm. Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander. But he <trigger id='trigger-26'>said</trigger> he was later told “that the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable.” In an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub <trigger id='trigger-12'>bombings</trigger> as “a total disaster.” He added that the secret ‘ Feakle Talks’, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub <trigger id='trigger-13'>bombings</trigger>. The talks, in Feakle, County Clare, involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip-off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans. But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22, 1974. Conway had been recruited in 1970, having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements. He met with senior republicans, including future deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. Adams continues to deny that he was ever in the IRA. Conway was later jailed in Belfast’s notorious Crumlin Road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status. Although he left the IRA in 1975, he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike, then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the British and Irish governments announced the Downing Street Declaration. He claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition. “The IRA went on ceasefire, it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do, and disappeared into history,” he <trigger id='trigger-27'>said</trigger>. “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.” In his book he also claims that rogue Irish police officers colluded with the IRA throughout the Troubles and that members of the Dublin establishment, including several mainstream politicians, aided the Provisionals in their armed campaign. * Southside Provisional: From Freedom Fighter to The Four Courts is published by Orpen press.

wiki_drone_strikes_1_news_1,"By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press TOKYO (AP) — Japanese police have <trigger id='trigger-0'>arrested</trigger> a man who admitted to landing a drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday. Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan. The small drone <trigger id='trigger-1'>found</trigger> Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist <trigger id='trigger-6'>attacks</trigger> using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers'office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there. No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident. Police said Yamamoto was <trigger id='trigger-4'>arrested</trigger> on suspicion of flying the drone and <trigger id='trigger-5'>obstructing</trigger> duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning. Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy. Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant <trigger id='trigger-3'>disaster</trigger>. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible. The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment. The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said. The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones. It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone. A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name""Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa""contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device. In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee <trigger id='trigger-2'>crashed</trigger> on the White House grounds.
